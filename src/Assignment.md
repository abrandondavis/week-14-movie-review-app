# Movie Voting and Review Application

Using the knowledge acquired this week, the objective is to create a web application page that allows users to vote and leave reviews on movies. You have the option to fetch movie data, including movies and reviews, from an API or create them manually for this assignment.

## Application Components

Your application must include the following components:

### 1. MovieList
   - A container that holds all the Movie components and their respective data.

### 2. Movie
   - A component that represents movie data, which includes elements such as the movie's image, synopsis, rating, and more.

### 3. Stars
   - A reusable one to five-star rating component that permits users to rate movies. Remember that components are reusable, so you can potentially use this component elsewhere in your application!

### 4. ReviewList
   - A container located inside a Movie component that houses Review components.

### 5. Review
   - A text review component that enables users to leave feedback on a particular movie.

### 6. ReviewForm
   - A form positioned at the bottom of the Movie component that enables users to submit reviews. Once submitted, the review should be added to the movie. You can manage this data using an array; there is no need for networking or a database for this assignment.

## Assignment Notes

- Ensure that the application is user-friendly and provides a seamless experience for voting and leaving reviews on movies.
- You have the flexibility to either fetch movie data from an API or manually create movie and review data.
- Pay attention to the organization and structure of your components to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Ensure that the Stars component is reusable, as it can be utilized in other parts of the application.
- Implement the ability for users to submit reviews through the ReviewForm, and make sure they are correctly associated with the corresponding movies.
- While no networking or database is required for this assignment, focus on the functionality and appearance of the application.
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected, including the ability to vote and leave reviews on movies.
- Make the user interface visually appealing and intuitive to enhance the user experience.
